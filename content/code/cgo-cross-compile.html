  <hr>

  <p>I started using Go with Cgo to use SDL to make a basic Snake game. I used the SDL-Go bindings provided by veandco. 
  <br>
Now that the game is done, how do I get it running on Windows?

Go has amazing cross-compiling options for Go-only code where changing GOOS="windows" - just works but this gets icky when using Cgo.

Cross compiling to Windows from Linux poses two problems:

Linux to Windows cross compiler is required.
Windows based 'devel' headers  are required. These headers should be compatible with the cross-compiler. 
Solution:
mingw-w64 is 64-bit GCC on Windows, it works as a cross-compiler on Linux. Available on most Linux distributions.
mingw compatible development headers for SDL is officially provided for SDL Core and its extension libraries. Copy the x86_64 and i686 folders to /usr/ (Or wherever your distribution stores mingw-w64 specific libraries.
Required flags for cross-compile:
Paths are for ArchLinux, use your system specific paths
<br>
<code>
CGO_ENABLED="1"
CC="/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
GOOS="windows"
CGO_LDFLAGS="-lmingw32 -L/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib -lSDL2main -lSDL2"
CGO_CFLAGS="-I/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/SDL2 -D_REENTRANT" 
</code>
Followed by "go build snake.go"


Full command: 
env CGO_ENABLED="1" CC="/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc" GOOS="windows" CGO_LDFLAGS="-lmingw32 -L/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib -lSDL2main -lSDL2" CGO_CFLAGS="-I/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/SDL2 -D_REENTRANT" go build -x -i -v snake.go
Explanation of Flags
Remember, Cgo is disabled by default while cross-compiling. 
As per official docs, you can permanently set CC_FOR_TARGET="/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc" or just change your CC for that specific command.
GOOS="windows" tells go to cross compile. 
Mingw-w64 requires the "-lmingw32" to work properly. SDL configs can be found by running "sdl2-config --libs", change path to mingw-w64. "-lSDL2main" is requirement for SDL2 on Windows.
Run "sdl2-config --cflags" and change the path to mingw-w64.
Your code should successfully compile and create snake.exe. Copy the .dlls found in /bin/ folder in the tarballs you downloaded from the official site beside the game.

Depending what features of SDL you used your game folder should look similar to the following when given "ls":

libfreetype-6.dll*  LICENSE.freetype.txt  LICENSE.zlib.txt  SDL2.dll*  SDL2_ttf.dll*  snake.exe*  font.ttf  zlib1.dll*

Your game now works on Windows.

Compatibility:
mingw is the officially supported Cgo compiler on Windows, so I presume all cross compiled programs should run fine.

My system specs:
Go 1.9.1, Archlinux x64, x86_64-w64-mingw32 targetting GCC 7.2</p>
